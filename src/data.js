          product cohorts to engineer a robust and well documented product that

          Working at Fathom allowed me to work alongside a number of
          highly-skilled professionals on a range of challenging fintech
          projects. The majority of my time was spent working with React, with
          additional exposure to React Native, GatsbyJS and Angular 2.
